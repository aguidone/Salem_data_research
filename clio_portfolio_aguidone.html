          <p>
This visualization essay is my innitial exporation of what the database on Salem sailors contains. I explored using complexion and position aboard ship to learn as much as I could from the data. I have visualized my findings through graphs and extended my questions as far as possible without using traditional historical sources.

          <h4><a href="https://aguidone.github.io/Salem_data_research/salem_mapping.html"><u>Essay 2: Mapping Essay</u></a></h4>

          <p>

This essay maps the birthplaces of black sailors departing Salem, MA, from 1797-1832. First birthplaces are shown across the world and then the mapping concentrates on the United States. This project is based on the same data set as Essay #1 except in this visualization I am using sailors described as "black" or "dark" rather than those described as "brown", "yellow", "olive" or "mulatto" like I did in Essay #1.

          <p>

This essay is a text-analysis of a corpus of newspapers describing the return tour of the Marquis de Lafayette through the United States from 1824-1825. It is from a pdf of volumes I, II, and III of "Lafayette: Guest of the Nation, a Contemporary Account of the Triumphal Tour of General Lafayette" edited by Edgar E. Brandon. It was downloaded from Hathitrust.org

          <p>

This essay is different from the others in that it is demonstrating how to use the R package "ggraph". Thus, all the code is included whereas in the other essays it was removed. This is a package which essentially allows you to make your network graphs look nicer and more user friendly. It also is easier to manipulate because it builds on prior "grammer of graphics" verbs learned in more popular R packages.
